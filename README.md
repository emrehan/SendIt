# SendIt
Delivers your packages in real world! ...well where PostMates is present.

## How it works
[Postmates](https://postmates.com/) is a startup to bring food to your door. This app hacks Postmate's API so that the courier is directed towards you to take up the order. 
In the first screen you choose the destination of the package you want to send. You will see the estimated cost and delivery time instantly.
